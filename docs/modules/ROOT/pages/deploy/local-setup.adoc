= Local setup

This document aims to assist users in setting up Inji Web on their local environment, offering step-by-step instructions to replicate the platform's functionality on their machine for development or testing purposes.

=== Repositories:

Clone the repositories locally to bring up your own setup. Repository information can be fetched from [_here_](https://github.com/mosip/inji-web.git).

_Pre-requisite:_

In order to run Inji Web locally, Node 18 is required. Please follow the below steps to install node.

Node 18 can be installed using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Run the following commands to install node:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install 18
----

==== Folder Structure:

_ _helm:* folder contains helm charts required to deploy on K8S
_ _inji-web:* contains the source code and Dockerfile
_ _docker-compose:* contains docker-compose.yml, environment files, and service configurations.
* [README link](https://github.com/mosip/inji-web/blob/master/README.md)

__*

== Run Inji Web locally using Docker Compose:

This setup uses Docker Compose to run _DataShare Service (Service to store VC)_, _Mimoto Service_ (Backend for Frontend) and _Inji Web_ (Frontend) together locally, providing a simple and easy-to-manage environment.

=== Steps:

. _Navigate to the `inji-web` folder and build the Inji Web image locally._

[source,bash]
----
cd ./inji-web
docker build -t inji-web:local .
----

. _Prepare the environment:_
   * In the `docker-compose` folder, there are configuration files and certificates for integrating Mimoto as the BFF (Backend for Frontend) for the web and mobile services.
   _ _Create a `certs` folder* in the `docker-compose` directory and add the necessary OIDC client certificate (as mentioned below).
   _ _Update the configuration files:*
     * `mimoto-issuers-config.json` (Add Id providers as issuers)
     * `mimoto-trusted-verifiers.json` (Add verifiers clientId and redirect URI for online sharing)
     _ Update _Esignet host references* in the `mimoto-default.properties`, `mimoto-issuers-config.json` files.
     * Set the `oidc_p12_password` environment variable value as per the documentation.
   _ _Create OIDC client* and generate `oidckeystore.p12`. You can follow the setup guide for this process [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/customization-overview/credential_providers).
   _ _Update `mimoto-issuers-config.json`* with the client ID and client alias as per your OIDC onboarding.

. _[Optional] Configure Google OAuth Client Credentials_
   * Refer to the [How to create Google Client Credentials](#how-to-create-google-client-credentials) section below. 
   * Add the generated credentials to docker-compose.yml:
[source,`yaml]
----
        environment:
        - GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
        - GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
----
. _Start the Docker Compose environment:_

[source,bash]
----
cd docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
----

. _Stop the Docker Compose environment:_

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down
----

__*

== Run Inji Web locally (Non-Docker Compose Setup):

If you'd prefer to run Inji Web without Docker Compose, you can manually set up and run the app on your local machine.

. _Navigate to the `inji-web` folder and install dependencies:_

[source,bash]
----
cd ./inji-web
npm install
----

. _Start the Inji Web application:_

[source,bash]
----
npm start
----

.  _Troubleshooting CORS issues:_

    If you encounter CORS errors when running the web app locally, you will need to set up a proxy server and configure it to point to `https://api.collab.mosip.net` for Mimoto's API.

    * Follow this [guide](https://jakemccambley.medium.com/fixing-cors-errors-when-working-with-3rd-party-apis-a69dc5474804) to set up the proxy.
    * Once the proxy server is running, update the `Inji Web` app to use the proxy by modifying the `window.location.origin` in the `src/utils/api.ts` file.
. _Run tests:_

[source,bash]
----
npm test
----
__*
== How to create Google Client Credentials

To enable Google OAuth2.0 authentication, follow these steps:

. _Go to the Google Cloud Console_:
    * Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

. _Create a New Project_:
    * If you donâ€™t already have a project, create a new one by clicking on the project dropdown and selecting "New Project".

. _Enable the OAuth Consent Screen_:
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".
    * Select "External" for the user type and configure the required fields (e.g., app name, support email, etc.).
    * Save the changes.
. _Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials_:
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    * Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs".
    * Select "Web application" as the application type.

. _Configure Authorized JavaScript Origins_:
   Depending on your environment, use the following values:
----
      http://localhost:8099
----
. _Configure Authorized Redirect URIs_:
----
      http://localhost:8099/v1/mimoto/oauth2/callback/google
----
. _Save and Retrieve Client Credentials_:
    * After saving, you will receive a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

=== Summary:

_ _Docker Compose Setup*: This is the recommended setup for running Inji Web along with Mimoto locally.
_ _Standalone Setup*: If you prefer, you can run Inji Web as a standalone Node.js application.
