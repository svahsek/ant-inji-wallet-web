____
 _Inji Web isn't just a web interface – it's a bridge to digital inclusion, enabling secure and seamless access to digital identity and credentials, even without a smartphone. Built to support open and equitable digital ecosystems for everyone._
____

Inji Web, akin to the [Inji Wallet](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/overview), is an open-source, standards-compliant web-based wallet that enables users to _securely download, manage, and share Verifiable Credentials (VCs)_ through a web interface. This easy-to-use platform enables users to access and store their credentials, ensuring confident presentation to service providers for verification and service access, with ease and reliability. Rooted in the principles of inclusivity, it empowers individuals to access benefits or services, even without smartphones.

_Inji Web_ is a reference implementation which can be adopted by _ecoystem partners, countries, system integrators (SIs),goverments and organizations_—built _with_ the community.

* _Service Providers_ can extend, customize, or white-label the solution  
* _Governments_ can deploy it for inclusive, public-facing identity journeys  
* _Developers_ can contribute, fork, and innovate to suit local needs


It’s ideal for communities with limited smartphone access and ensures full interoperability with open digital identity ecosystems using:

=== Core Design Principles

* _Web Accessibility for All_  
  Full credential access via desktop or shared devices.

* _Standard-Compliant Architecture_  
  Based on OpenID4VCI, W3C VC Data Model, SD-JWT (in progress), and OpenID4VP (upcoming).

* _User-Controlled Credential Sharing_  
  Complete control over how, when, and with whom to share.

* _Modular and Configurable Login System_  
  Supports Google and other OpenID-compliant IdPs.

* _Trustworthy Credential Lifecycle_  
  Credentials are digitally signed by issuers, tamper-evident, and easily verifiable.

=== Capabilities Snapshot

* _Login with Any IdP_  
  Access your wallet using Google or any OpenID-compliant Identity Provider.

* _Download from Trusted Issuers_  
  Select an issuer, enter UIN/VID/Registration Number or any unique identifier, and securely download credentials.

* _Web Wallet Storage (Post-login)_  
  Credentials are stored in your secure, logged-in web wallet session—enabling access across sessions and devices, depending on configuration.

* _Local Storage Support_  
  Optionally download credentials as digitally signed PDFs with embedded QR codes for offline use or physical copies.

* _Easy Credential Sharing_  
  Share credentials via QR code scan, PDF upload, or printed presentation.

* _Interoperability with Verifiers_  
  Fully compatible with Inji Verify and other OpenID4VP-compliant verifier portals.

* _Flexible Identity Inputs_  
  Authenticate using UIN, Date of Birth, or Registration Number for credential retrieval.

   * Scan QR code  
   * Present printed credential
  
. _Use as Guest (No Login)_

=== Sneak Peek: Upcoming Features

* W3C VC Data Model 2.0 Support  
* SVG-based Credential Templates  
* Selective Disclosure via SD-JWT  
* Presentation During Issuance

=== Technology and Integration

Inji Web interacts with:

* [Mimoto APIs](https://mosip.stoplight.io/docs/mimoto/5bf5a1n68g4tq-mimoto) for managing issuers details, facilitate VC download and generate PDF
* [eSignet APIs](https://mosip.stoplight.io/docs/identity-provider/jlmszj6dlxigw-e-signet) for authentication
