= Version 0.13.0

_Release Name_: Inji Web Wallet 0.13.0

_Release Type_: Developer  

_Release Date_: 29th July, 2025

=== Overview

This release of _Inji Web Wallet v0.13.0_ marks a significant milestone with the introduction of _Identity Provider (IDP) based login_, enabling users to seamlessly log in using their _Google account_. This enhancement makes credential access and management more intuitive and accessible, especially for users new to the ecosystem.

Once logged in via Google, users can _securely download and store their credentials_ in the _Stored Cards_ section of the web wallet. This introduces a more user-friendly and federated authentication model aligned with modern identity standards. Together, these updates strengthen the Inji Web Wallet's position as a secure, standards-compliant, and user-friendly platform for managing verifiable credentials.

* _Multiple new API integrations_ to support login, token validation, and credential retrieval workflows  
* _New database structures_ for securely managing user sessions and credential metadata  
* _Enhanced OpenID4VCI compliance_, including proper handling of `c_nonce` and token types  
* _UI responsiveness improvements_ across devices  
* _Security updates_, addressing cryptographic best practices and container hardening  
* _Expanded test automation_ for login, credential management, and passcode flows 
* Enhanced error handling for OAuth2 login and download APIs
